You are reviewing an Epic EHI data mapping for semantic correctness. Before analyzing the specific mapping below, read the full data model documentation and mapping philosophy — it is essential context for understanding relationship types, CSN semantics, and structural decisions.

## Data Model & Mapping Philosophy

The following is extracted from the projector's documentation. It defines the three relationship types (structural child, cross-reference, provenance stamp), explains CSN semantics, the order parent→child chain, billing as a parallel hierarchy, and the mapping philosophy. **Use this to evaluate whether structural decisions in the code below are correct.**

<methodology>
# Epic EHI Data Model

500-600 TSV files, each representing one database table. There are no
foreign key constraints in the export — relationships are implicit.


## 1. TABLE SPLITTING
Epic splits wide tables across multiple files with _2, _3, ... suffixes.
PATIENT has 6 files (PATIENT, PATIENT_2..6), PAT_ENC has 7, ORDER_MED
has 7, etc. 27 base tables produce 62 additional split files.

CRITICAL GOTCHA: The primary key column name often changes across splits!
  - ACCOUNT.ACCOUNT_ID → ACCOUNT_2.ACCT_ID → ACCOUNT_3.ACCOUNT_ID
  - ORDER_MED.ORDER_MED_ID → ORDER_MED_2.ORDER_ID
  - COVERAGE.COVERAGE_ID → COVERAGE_2.CVG_ID
  - PAT_ENC base PK is PAT_ID (multi-row) but splits join on PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
    except PAT_ENC_3 which uses PAT_ENC_CSN (no _ID suffix)

The VALUES match, the NAMES don't. split_config.json documents every join
column for all 27 groups. Don't try to infer them — look them up.


## 2. THREE RELATIONSHIP TYPES
Every table in the export fits one of three roles:

a) STRUCTURAL CHILD — lives inside its parent, joined on parent PK.
   Examples: ORDER_RESULTS under ORDER_PROC (on ORDER_PROC_ID),
   ALLERGY_REACTIONS under ALLERGY (on ALLERGY_ID).
   These nest naturally: order.results = [...]

b) CROSS-REFERENCE — has its own identity, points to another entity.
   Example: ARPB_VISITS.PRIM_ENC_CSN_ID points to an encounter.
   The billing visit is NOT owned by the encounter — it's a separate
   entity in a parallel hierarchy. Model as typed ID + accessor method:
     encounter.billingVisit(record) / billingVisit.encounter(record)

c) PROVENANCE STAMP — a CSN on a patient-level record that means
   "this was edited during encounter X", NOT "this belongs to encounter X".
   Example: ALLERGY.ALLERGY_PAT_CSN records which encounter the allergy
   was noted in. Don't nest allergies under encounters — they belong to
   the patient. The CSN is metadata about when/where, not ownership.

The hardest part of mapping a new table is deciding which type it is.
When in doubt, read the Epic column description from schemas/*.json.


## 3. CONTACTS, SERIAL NUMBERS, AND THE CSN

TERMINOLOGY:
  "Contact"       = any recorded interaction with the health system.
                    A clinical visit is a contact. But so is a history
                    review, a phone call, a MyChart message, an admin
                    task, or a lab processing event.
  "Serial Number" = a unique integer Epic assigns to each contact.
  "CSN"           = Contact Serial Number. The unique ID of a contact.

CRITICAL MENTAL MODEL:

  PAT_ENC is the table of ALL contacts — not just clinical visits.
  Each row in PAT_ENC gets a unique CSN (PAT_ENC_CSN_ID). But the
  111 rows in our test patient's PAT_ENC break down as:

    ~30  Clinical visits (have diagnoses, orders, or reasons for visit)
      5  History review contacts (SOCIAL_HX, SURGICAL_HX records)
     76  Other contacts (phone calls, MyChart, admin, metadata-only)

  When a clinician reviews social history during a visit, Epic creates
  TWO contacts on the same date, same provider, same department:

    CSN 799951565  — the clinical visit (3 diagnoses, 1 order, 2 reasons)
    CSN 802802103  — the social history review (0 diagnoses, 0 orders)

  Both are rows in PAT_ENC. The history contact exists to record WHEN
  the history was reviewed. SOCIAL_HX links to both:
    - PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = 802802103 (the history's own contact)
    - HX_LNK_ENC_CSN = 799951565 (the clinical visit it was part of)

  This is why you cannot treat PAT_ENC as "the visits table." Many
  CSNs are system-generated contacts with no clinical content.

WHERE CSN COLUMNS APPEAR AND WHAT THEY MEAN:

  PAT_ENC_CSN_ID    Standard FK to a contact. On child tables
                    (PAT_ENC_DX, ORDER_PROC, HNO_INFO), it means
                    "this record belongs to contact X." On history
                    tables (SOCIAL_HX), it means "this IS contact X."
                    Found on 28+ tables.

  PRIM_ENC_CSN_ID   "Primary encounter CSN." Used in billing (ARPB_VISITS,
                    HAR_ALL). Points to the clinical visit contact,
                    not a system-generated one. This is how billing
                    connects to clinical data.

  HX_LNK_ENC_CSN    "History link encounter CSN." On SOCIAL_HX,
                    SURGICAL_HX, FAMILY_HX_STATUS. Points to the
                    clinical visit where the history was reviewed.
                    Different from PAT_ENC_CSN_ID on the same row.

  NOTE_CSN_ID        The note's OWN contact serial number. Different
                    from PAT_ENC_CSN_ID on HNO_INFO, which tells you
                    which clinical encounter the note belongs to.

  ALLERGY_PAT_CSN    Provenance stamp on ALLERGY: "this allergy was
                    noted during contact X." NOT structural ownership —
                    allergies belong to the patient, not the encounter.

  IMM_CSN            Immunization contact. The contact during which
                    the immunization was administered or recorded.

  MEDS_LAST_REV_CSN  On PATIENT: "encounter where meds were last
                    reviewed." A timestamp-style provenance stamp.

  ALRG_HX_REV_EPT_CSN  "Encounter where allergy history was reviewed."

THE KEY QUESTION WHEN YOU SEE A CSN COLUMN: does it mean
  (a) "this record BELONGS TO this contact"  → structural child
  (b) "this record IS this contact"           → the contact itself
  (c) "this record was TOUCHED during this contact" → provenance stamp
  (d) "this links to the CLINICAL VISIT contact"   → cross-reference
The column name alone doesn't tell you — read the schema description.


## 4. THE ORDER PARENT→CHILD CHAIN (LAB RESULTS)
When a provider orders labs, Epic creates a parent ORDER_PROC. When
the lab runs, Epic spawns a child ORDER_PROC with a different
ORDER_PROC_ID. Results attach to the CHILD order, not the parent.

  ORDER_PROC_ID 945468368  (parent, "LIPID PANEL")
    → ORDER_RESULTS: empty
  ORDER_PROC_ID 945468371  (child, same test)
    → ORDER_RESULTS: CHOLESTEROL=159, HDL=62, LDL=84, TRIG=67, VLDL=13

  ORDER_PARENT_INFO links them:
    PARENT_ORDER_ID=945468368  ORDER_ID=945468371

In our test data, parent and child orders share the same CSN (both
live on the same contact). In larger institutions, the child order
may land on a separate lab-processing contact with a different CSN.
Either way, the ORDER_PROC_ID is always different, and results always
attach to the child's ORDER_PROC_ID.

Without following ORDER_PARENT_INFO, lab results appear disconnected
from the ordering encounter. The Order.allResults(record) method
handles this automatically.


## 5. NOTE LINKING IS INDIRECT
HNO_INFO (notes) has both PAT_ENC_CSN_ID and its own contact CSN.
  - PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = the clinical encounter this note belongs to
  - NOTE_CSN_ID = the note's own contact serial number (internal)

Some notes have NULL PAT_ENC_CSN_ID — these are standalone MyChart
messages, system notifications, or notes not tied to a visit.
Only 57 of 152 notes in our test data link to encounters.
Only 21 of 152 have plain text — the rest may be in RTF format,
were redacted, or are system-generated stubs with metadata only.


## 6. HISTORY TABLES ARE VERSIONED SNAPSHOTS
SOCIAL_HX, SURGICAL_HX, FAMILY_HX_STATUS each have two CSN columns:
  - PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = the history record's own contact CSN (gets own encounter)
  - HX_LNK_ENC_CSN = the clinical encounter where history was reviewed

Each row is a point-in-time snapshot, not a child of any encounter.
They are patient-level versioned records. We model them as
HistoryTimeline<T> with .latest(), .asOfEncounter(csn), .asOfDate(date).


## 7. BRIDGE TABLES FOR PATIENT LINKAGE
Several entity tables store one record per entity (not per patient)
and link to patients through bridge tables:

  ALLERGY ←─── PAT_ALLERGIES ───→ PATIENT (via PAT_ID)
  PROBLEM_LIST ← PAT_PROBLEM_LIST → PATIENT
  IMMUNE ←──── PAT_IMMUNIZATIONS → PATIENT
  ACCOUNT ←─── ACCT_GUAR_PAT_INFO → PATIENT
  HSP_ACCOUNT ← HAR_ALL ──────────→ PATIENT (via PAT_ID + ACCT_ID)

In single-patient exports, you CAN SELECT * and get correct results,
but always join through the bridge for multi-patient correctness.


## 8. CLARITY_* TABLES ARE SHARED LOOKUPS
~23 tables starting with CLARITY_ are reference/dimension tables:
  CLARITY_EDG = diagnoses (DX_ID → DX_NAME)
  CLARITY_SER = providers (PROV_ID → PROV_NAME)
  CLARITY_DEP = departments (DEPARTMENT_ID → DEPARTMENT_NAME)
  CLARITY_EAP = procedures (PROC_ID → PROC_NAME)
  CLARITY_EMP = employees

They're shared across the whole graph — don't nest them anywhere.
Use lookupName() to resolve IDs to display names at projection time.


## 9. BILLING IS A PARALLEL HIERARCHY
Clinical data (PAT_ENC → orders → results) and billing data
(ARPB_TRANSACTIONS → actions → diagnoses → EOB) are parallel trees
connected by cross-references:

  Clinical tree:                    Billing tree:
  PAT_ENC                           ARPB_TRANSACTIONS
    ├── ORDER_PROC                    ├── ARPB_TX_ACTIONS
    │   └── ORDER_RESULTS             ├── ARPB_CHG_ENTRY_DX
    ├── HNO_INFO                      ├── TX_DIAG
    └── PAT_ENC_DX                   └── PMT_EOB_INFO_I/II
                                    ACCOUNT
                cross-ref:           ├── ACCOUNT_CONTACT
  ARPB_VISITS.PRIM_ENC_CSN_ID       └── ACCT_TX
       ↔ PAT_ENC_CSN_ID           HSP_ACCOUNT
                                     ├── HSP_TRANSACTIONS
                                     └── buckets → payments
                                   CLM_VALUES (claims)
                                     └── SVC_LN_INFO
                                   CL_REMIT (remittances)
                                     └── 14 child tables

Don't stuff billing under encounters — it's its own tree.


## 10. EPIC COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS ARE THE ROSETTA STONE
The schemas/*.json files (from open.epic.com) contain natural-language
descriptions for every column. These often include explicit relationship
hints: "frequently used to link to the PATIENT table", "The unique ID of
the immunization record", "The contact serial number associated with the
primary patient contact."

When extending to a new table, ALWAYS read the schema description first.
A human (or LLM) reading descriptions + one sample row can make correct
placement judgments where heuristic FK matching fails.

# Mapping Philosophy

## 1. NESTING EXPRESSES OWNERSHIP, NOT ALL RELATIONSHIPS
   Structural children (ORDER_RESULTS under ORDER_PROC) nest directly.
   Cross-references (billing ↔ encounters) use typed IDs + accessor methods.
   Provenance stamps (ALLERGY.ALLERGY_PAT_CSN) are metadata fields.

## 2. CONVENIENCE METHODS LIVE ON THE ENTITY THAT HOLDS THE FK
   encounter.billingVisit(record) — encounter has the CSN, billing visit
   points to it. billingVisit.encounter(record) — reverse direction.
   Both entities carry their own accessor for the relationship.

## 3. THE `record` PARAMETER IS THE INDEX
   Cross-reference accessors take PatientRecord as a parameter so they
   can use O(1) index lookups (encounterByCSN, orderByID). This keeps
   entities serializable and the dependency explicit.

## 4. EpicRow AS ESCAPE HATCH
   We can't type all 550 tables immediately. EpicRow = Record<string, unknown>
   lets child tables land somewhere even before they're fully typed.
   The ChildSpec[] arrays attach children systematically — typing comes later.

## 5. PAT_ID FILTERING FOR MULTI-PATIENT CORRECTNESS
   Every top-level query traces back to PAT_ID, even if the path goes
   through bridge tables (PAT_ALLERGIES, HAR_ALL, ACCT_GUAR_PAT_INFO).
   Single-patient exports happen to work without this, but multi-patient
   databases require it.

## 6. FALLBACK GRACEFULLY
   Every query checks tableExists() before running. If a bridge table is
   missing, fall back to SELECT * (correct for single-patient exports).
   If a child table is absent, skip it. The projection should work for
   partial exports and different Epic versions.

# Field Naming and Interpretation

Common Epic column suffixes and what they mean:

  _C_NAME     Category value. Epic stores categories as integers internally
              and provides the human-readable name in the _C_NAME column.
              Example: TX_TYPE_C_NAME = "Charge" (not the raw category ID)

  _YN         Yes/No flag. Values are "Y" or "N" (strings, not booleans).

  _ID         A foreign key or primary key. May point to another table
              (DX_ID → CLARITY_EDG) or be an internal Epic identifier.

  _ID_NAME    A denormalized name column. When Epic exports TABLE.FK_ID,
              it often includes TABLE.FK_ID_NAME with the resolved name.
              Example: ALLERGEN_ID + ALLERGEN_ID_ALLERGEN_NAME

  _DTTM       Datetime (format: "9/28/2023 9:38:00 AM")

  _DATE_REAL  Epic's internal date format (a float: days since epoch).
              Usually accompanied by a human-readable CONTACT_DATE.

  _CSN        Contact serial number. See "CSN Column Name Chaos" above.

  LINE        Multi-row child record line number. Tables like PAT_ENC_DX
              use LINE to number multiple diagnoses per encounter.
              The combination of (parent FK + LINE) is the composite key.

  PAT_ENC_DATE_REAL  Almost always in the first column of encounter child
                     tables. Not useful for joining — use PAT_ENC_CSN_ID.

# Column Safety: Zero Silent Mismatches

## The Problem

`EpicRow = Record<string, unknown>` makes every column access an
unchecked string lookup. A typo returns `undefined`. The value flows
through `as string`, becomes `null` in the HealthRecord, and nobody
notices. The spike currently has **29 phantom column references** in
HealthRecord.ts alone — fields that are always null because the column
name is wrong.

No amount of testing the *output* catches this reliably, because null
is a valid value for most fields. You can't distinguish "null because
the patient has no marital status" from "null because you typed
MARITAL_STATUS_C_NAME and the column is actually MARITAL_STAT_C_NAME".

## The Solution: Three Layers

### Layer 1: StrictRow Proxy (runtime, catches everything)

Wrap every row returned from SQLite in a `Proxy` that throws if you
access a column that doesn't exist on that row:

```ts
function q(sql: string, table: string): StrictEpicRow[] {
  return db.query(sql).all().map(row => strictRow(row, table));
}
```

Now `row.SMOKING_PACKS_PER_DAY` on a SOCIAL_HX row throws:
```
Column "SMOKING_PACKS_PER_DAY" does not exist in SOCIAL_HX.
Available: TOBACCO_USER_C_NAME, ALCOHOL_USE_C_NAME, ...
```

**This is the kill switch.** If the full projection runs to completion
with StrictRow enabled, every column access in the codebase is valid.
One test — `bun run project.ts --strict` — proves zero mismatches.

Synthetic columns (child attachments like `row.reactions = [...]`,
computed fields like `row._dx_name`) are whitelisted via a set
populated from ChildSpec keys.

Cost: ~5% runtime overhead from Proxy. Use `--strict` in CI, skip in
production if needed.

### Layer 2: Column Manifest (static, catches drift)

For each entity type, declare what you read:

```ts
const SOCIAL_HX_MANIFEST = {
  mapped: [
    'TOBACCO_USER_C_NAME',    // → socialHistory.tobacco.status
    'ALCOHOL_USE_C_NAME',     // → socialHistory.alcohol.status
    'ALCOHOL_COMMENT',        // → socialHistory.alcohol.comment
    'IV_DRUG_USER_YN',        // → socialHistory.drugs.status
    'ILLICIT_DRUG_CMT',       // → socialHistory.drugs.comment
    'SEXUALLY_ACTIVE_C_NAME', // → socialHistory.sexualActivity
    'CONTACT_DATE',           // → socialHistory.asOf
    'PAT_ENC_CSN_ID',        // → timeline key
    'HX_LNK_ENC_CSN',        // → timeline key
  ],
  skipped: [
    'CIGARETTES_YN',          // redundant with TOBACCO_USER_C_NAME
    'PIPES_YN',               // not clinically actionable
    // ...
  ],
};
```

A test validates:
1. Every `mapped` column exists in the DB table
2. Every `skipped` column exists in the DB table
3. `mapped + skipped` = all columns with data in that table
4. No column with data is unaccounted for

When Epic adds a column in a new export, the test fails with
"SOCIAL_HX has unmanifested column NEW_COL_NAME with 5 values"
— forcing you to classify it as mapped or skipped.

### Layer 3: Codegen Types (compile-time, catches at edit time)

Generate TypeScript interfaces from `schemas/*.json`:

```ts
// generated/SOCIAL_HX.ts (auto-generated, do not edit)
export interface SOCIAL_HX_Row {
  CONTACT_DATE: string | null;
  CIGARETTES_YN: string | null;
  TOBACCO_USER_C_NAME: string | null;
  // ... every column from schema
}
```

Then:
```ts
function projectSocialHistory(row: SOCIAL_HX_Row) {
  row.SMOKING_PACKS_PER_DAY  // ← compile error: property does not exist
}
```

The data repo already has `04-codegen.ts` — this is the same idea,
applied to the projection code.

## Implementation Order

1. **StrictRow Proxy** — half day. Wrap `q()` and `mergeQuery()`.
   Run `project.ts --strict`. Fix every crash. Done: zero mismatches
   proven for this dataset.

2. **Column Manifest** — 1 day. Write manifests for the ~15 entity
   types. This catches drift when running against *different* EHI
   exports (different Epic versions, different institutions).

3. **Codegen Types** — 1 day. Auto-generate from schemas. This
   catches errors at edit time before you even run the code.

After all three: column mismatches are a **compile error** (layer 3),
a **test failure on any dataset** (layer 2), and a **runtime crash if
somehow both miss it** (layer 1).

</methodology>

## Your Task

Analyze the mapping pipeline for **Health Maintenance: HM_HISTORY + forecasts + guides** and identify every semantic error — places where a column is read successfully but the value means something different than the code assumes.

You are looking for these specific error types:
1. **Wrong column for the concept** — the code reads a column that exists but contains a different kind of data than intended (e.g., reading a category code integer instead of a display name string)
2. **Conflated columns** — the code falls back from one column to another using ??, but they have different meanings
3. **Structural misclassification** — data is nested/grouped incorrectly (e.g., a patient-level record nested under encounters)
4. **Cross-layer pipeline mismatch** — the projection stores a value under one property name, but the downstream consumer reads a different property name
5. **Missing data that exists** — a column with real data in the sample that the code never reads, causing a null where it could have a value
6. **Wrong interpretation** — dates parsed as strings, IDs treated as names, category codes treated as display values
7. **Aggregation errors** — queries without ORDER BY feeding into .latest() or similar, nondeterministic tie-breaking

For each issue found, report:
- **Severity**: CRITICAL (output is wrong), MODERATE (output is incomplete), LOW (cosmetic or edge case)
- **Location**: which file and which line/field
- **What happens**: the concrete wrong behavior
- **Fix**: the specific code change needed

## Epic Schema Descriptions

These are Epic's official descriptions for each column. They are the ground truth for what a column means.

### HM_FORECAST_INFO
**Table**: Health Maintenance forecast information for the next completion.
- **PAT_ID**: The unique ID of the patient record for this row. This column is frequently used to link to the PATIENT table.
- **LINE**: The line number for the information associated with this record. Multiple pieces of information can be associated with this record.

- **HM_FORECAST_TOPIC_ID_NAME**: The name of the health maintenance topic.
- **EARLIEST_VALID_DATE**: This column stores the earliest date that the current completion will be considered valid.

### HM_HISTORICAL_STATUS
**Table**: Records Health Maintenance status over time.
- **PAT_ID**: The unique ID of the patient record for this row. This column is frequently used to link to the PATIENT table.
- **LINE**: The line number for the information associated with this record. Multiple pieces of information can be associated with this record.
- **HM_TOPIC_ID**: The Health Maintenance topic that applied to the patient at the time the snapshot was taken.
- **HM_TOPIC_ID_NAME**: The name of the health maintenance topic.
- **HM_STATUS_C_NAME**: Indicates the patient's due status for the Health Maintenance topic at the time the snapshot was taken.
- **NEXT_DUE_DATE**: The patient's next due date for this Health Maintenance topic at the time the snapshot was taken.
- **LAST_COMPLETED_DATE**: The date this patient last had a completion for the Health Maintenance topic, as of the time the snapshot was taken.
- **HAS_OUTSIDE_COMPLETION_YN**: Indicates whether external data was used to complete the related Health Maintenance topic at the time the snapshot was recorded.
- **EXTERNAL_CLINICAL_DATE**: If the related HM topic is currently satisfied by external clinical data (e.g. Care Everywhere or immunization registries), this item will contain the date of the relevant completion.
- **EXTERNAL_CLAIM_DATE**: If the related HM topic is currently satisfied by external claims data, this item will contain the date of the relevant completion.
- **PAT_REPORTED_DATE**: If the related HM topic is currently satisfied by patient-reported data, this item will contain the date of the relevant patient-reported satisfaction.
- **EXTERNAL_HEALTH_PLAN_DATE**: If the related HM topic is currently satisfied by external health plan data, this item will contain the date of the relevant completion.

### HM_HISTORY
**Table**: The HM_HISTORY table records information about completed and manually overridden clinical system health maintenance topics that apply to each patient. This information is found in your system by the following path: clinical system Supervisor Menu > Supervisor's menu > Patient Health Maint option, or by clicking the clinical system client Health Maintenance button.
- **PAT_ID**: The unique ID assigned to the patient record. This ID may be encrypted if you have elected to use enterprise reporting�s encryption utility.
- **LINE**: Identifies the health maintenance topic within the patient�s record.

- **HM_COMP_UTC_DTTM**: Instant of Health Maintenance completion.

### PATIENT_HMT_STATUS
**Table**: This table contains information on the due status of health maintenance topics.
- **PAT_ID**: The unique ID of the patient record for this row. This column is frequently used to link to the PATIENT table.
- **LINE**: The Line Count
- **HMT_PPN_UNTL_DT**: The date until which a Health Maintenance topic is postponed.
- **HMT_PPN_RSN_C_NAME**: The postpone reason category number for a Health Maintenance topic which was postponed.
- **HMT_LAST_UPDATE_DT**: The date when the patient's qualified Health Maintenance topic due status was last updated.
- **HM_ORDER_STATUS_YN**: This item indicates if the Health Maintenance (HM) topic has been addressed by signing an order. If an appropriate active order was found during the HM update, this will be set to yes.
- **ACTIVE_SUBTOPIC_ID**: Stores the active subtopic for a combination topic
- **ACTIVE_SUBTOPIC_ID_NAME**: The name of the health maintenance topic.
- **ACTIVE_HM_PLAN_ID**: Stores the Health Maintenance plan that is currently active for the topic
- **ACTIVE_HM_PLAN_ID_HM_PLAN_NAME**: The name of the Health Maintenance Plan record.
- **HM_TENTATIVE_YN**: Boolean value indicating whether the Health Maintenance topic's next follow-up is tentative and requiring review.
- **HM_ACTIVE_SERIES_C_NAME**: Stores the active immunization series the patient is currently on.

### PAT_HM_CUR_GUIDE
**Table**: Health Maintenance Plans used during patient's last health maintenance update.
- **PAT_ID**: The unique ID of the patient record for this row. This column is frequently used to link to the PATIENT table.
- **LINE**: The line number for the information associated with this record. Multiple pieces of information can be associated with this record.
- **HM_CURRENT_GUIDE_ID**: Current Health Maintenance Plans the patient is a part of.
- **HM_CURRENT_GUIDE_ID_HM_PLAN_NAME**: The name of the Health Maintenance Plan record.

## Pipeline Code

### Stage 1: SQL Projection (project.ts → raw JSON)
```typescript
// ─── Inline in main() ───
  health_maintenance: {
    historical_status: tableExists("HM_HISTORICAL_STATUS") ? children("HM_HISTORICAL_STATUS", "PAT_ID", patId) : [],
    history: tableExists("HM_HISTORY") ? children("HM_HISTORY", "PAT_ID", patId) : [],
    current_guides: tableExists("PAT_HM_CUR_GUIDE") ? children("PAT_HM_CUR_GUIDE", "PAT_ID", patId) : [],
    topic_status: tableExists("PATIENT_HMT_STATUS") ? children("PATIENT_HMT_STATUS", "PAT_ID", patId) : [],
    forecast: tableExists("HM_FORECAST_INFO") ? children("HM_FORECAST_INFO", "PAT_ID", patId) : [],
  },
```

### Stage 2: Domain Model Hydration (PatientRecord.ts)
```typescript
// (raw EpicRow[], no typed class)
```

### Stage 3: Clean Projection (HealthRecord.ts → final output)
```typescript
// (no HealthRecord projection yet)
```

## Actual Output (from health_record_full.json)

```json
null
```

## Instructions

1. Read the Data Model & Mapping Philosophy section first. Understand the three relationship types (structural child, cross-reference, provenance stamp), what CSN columns mean on different tables, and the parallel clinical/billing hierarchy.
2. Read every column's Epic schema description carefully. The schema description is the ground truth for what a column means — column names are often misleading (e.g., SEVERITY_C_NAME is actually the allergy TYPE).
3. Trace each column from the SQL query through PatientRecord hydration to HealthRecord output.
4. For each field in the output, verify: is the source column correct for what this field claims to represent?
5. For each column in the sample data that has a value, verify: is it read by the code? If not, should it be?
6. Check property name continuity across the three stages — does stage 3 read the property that stage 2 wrote?
7. Evaluate structural decisions: is each table correctly classified as structural child, cross-reference, or provenance stamp? Are CSN columns interpreted correctly per the methodology?
8. Check for nondeterminism in queries (missing ORDER BY) and aggregations (tie-breaking).
9. Verify unit/type interpretations: are _C columns (raw category codes) distinguished from _C_NAME columns (display strings)? Are _YN flags correctly interpreted?
