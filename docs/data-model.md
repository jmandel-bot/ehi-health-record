# Epic EHI Data Model

500-600 TSV files, each representing one database table. There are no
foreign key constraints in the export — relationships are implicit.


## 1. TABLE SPLITTING
Epic splits wide tables across multiple files with _2, _3, ... suffixes.
PATIENT has 6 files (PATIENT, PATIENT_2..6), PAT_ENC has 7, ORDER_MED
has 7, etc. 27 base tables produce 62 additional split files.

CRITICAL GOTCHA: The primary key column name often changes across splits!
  - ACCOUNT.ACCOUNT_ID → ACCOUNT_2.ACCT_ID → ACCOUNT_3.ACCOUNT_ID
  - ORDER_MED.ORDER_MED_ID → ORDER_MED_2.ORDER_ID
  - COVERAGE.COVERAGE_ID → COVERAGE_2.CVG_ID
  - PAT_ENC base PK is PAT_ID (multi-row) but splits join on PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
    except PAT_ENC_3 which uses PAT_ENC_CSN (no _ID suffix)

The VALUES match, the NAMES don't. split_config.json documents every join
column for all 27 groups. Don't try to infer them — look them up.


## 2. THREE RELATIONSHIP TYPES
Every table in the export fits one of three roles:

a) STRUCTURAL CHILD — lives inside its parent, joined on parent PK.
   Examples: ORDER_RESULTS under ORDER_PROC (on ORDER_PROC_ID),
   ALLERGY_REACTIONS under ALLERGY (on ALLERGY_ID).
   These nest naturally: order.results = [...]

b) CROSS-REFERENCE — has its own identity, points to another entity.
   Example: ARPB_VISITS.PRIM_ENC_CSN_ID points to an encounter.
   The billing visit is NOT owned by the encounter — it's a separate
   entity in a parallel hierarchy. Model as typed ID + accessor method:
     encounter.billingVisit(record) / billingVisit.encounter(record)

c) PROVENANCE STAMP — a CSN on a patient-level record that means
   "this was edited during encounter X", NOT "this belongs to encounter X".
   Example: ALLERGY.ALLERGY_PAT_CSN records which encounter the allergy
   was noted in. Don't nest allergies under encounters — they belong to
   the patient. The CSN is metadata about when/where, not ownership.

The hardest part of mapping a new table is deciding which type it is.
When in doubt, read the Epic column description from schemas/*.json.


## 3. CONTACTS, SERIAL NUMBERS, AND THE CSN

TERMINOLOGY:
  "Contact"       = any recorded interaction with the health system.
                    A clinical visit is a contact. But so is a history
                    review, a phone call, a MyChart message, an admin
                    task, or a lab processing event.
  "Serial Number" = a unique integer Epic assigns to each contact.
  "CSN"           = Contact Serial Number. The unique ID of a contact.

CRITICAL MENTAL MODEL:

  PAT_ENC is the table of ALL contacts — not just clinical visits.
  Each row in PAT_ENC gets a unique CSN (PAT_ENC_CSN_ID). But the
  111 rows in our test patient's PAT_ENC break down as:

    ~30  Clinical visits (have diagnoses, orders, or reasons for visit)
      5  History review contacts (SOCIAL_HX, SURGICAL_HX records)
     76  Other contacts (phone calls, MyChart, admin, metadata-only)

  When a clinician reviews social history during a visit, Epic creates
  TWO contacts on the same date, same provider, same department:

    CSN 799951565  — the clinical visit (3 diagnoses, 1 order, 2 reasons)
    CSN 802802103  — the social history review (0 diagnoses, 0 orders)

  Both are rows in PAT_ENC. The history contact exists to record WHEN
  the history was reviewed. SOCIAL_HX links to both:
    - PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = 802802103 (the history's own contact)
    - HX_LNK_ENC_CSN = 799951565 (the clinical visit it was part of)

  This is why you cannot treat PAT_ENC as "the visits table." Many
  CSNs are system-generated contacts with no clinical content.

WHERE CSN COLUMNS APPEAR AND WHAT THEY MEAN:

  PAT_ENC_CSN_ID    Standard FK to a contact. On child tables
                    (PAT_ENC_DX, ORDER_PROC, HNO_INFO), it means
                    "this record belongs to contact X." On history
                    tables (SOCIAL_HX), it means "this IS contact X."
                    Found on 28+ tables.

  PRIM_ENC_CSN_ID   "Primary encounter CSN." Used in billing (ARPB_VISITS,
                    HAR_ALL). Points to the clinical visit contact,
                    not a system-generated one. This is how billing
                    connects to clinical data.

  HX_LNK_ENC_CSN    "History link encounter CSN." On SOCIAL_HX,
                    SURGICAL_HX, FAMILY_HX_STATUS. Points to the
                    clinical visit where the history was reviewed.
                    Different from PAT_ENC_CSN_ID on the same row.

  NOTE_CSN_ID        The note's OWN contact serial number. Different
                    from PAT_ENC_CSN_ID on HNO_INFO, which tells you
                    which clinical encounter the note belongs to.

  ALLERGY_PAT_CSN    Provenance stamp on ALLERGY: "this allergy was
                    noted during contact X." NOT structural ownership —
                    allergies belong to the patient, not the encounter.

  IMM_CSN            Immunization contact. The contact during which
                    the immunization was administered or recorded.

  MEDS_LAST_REV_CSN  On PATIENT: "encounter where meds were last
                    reviewed." A timestamp-style provenance stamp.

  ALRG_HX_REV_EPT_CSN  "Encounter where allergy history was reviewed."

THE KEY QUESTION WHEN YOU SEE A CSN COLUMN: does it mean
  (a) "this record BELONGS TO this contact"  → structural child
  (b) "this record IS this contact"           → the contact itself
  (c) "this record was TOUCHED during this contact" → provenance stamp
  (d) "this links to the CLINICAL VISIT contact"   → cross-reference
The column name alone doesn't tell you — read the schema description.


## 4. THE ORDER PARENT→CHILD CHAIN (LAB RESULTS)
When a provider orders labs, Epic creates a parent ORDER_PROC. When
the lab runs, Epic spawns a child ORDER_PROC with a different
ORDER_PROC_ID. Results attach to the CHILD order, not the parent.

  ORDER_PROC_ID 945468368  (parent, "LIPID PANEL")
    → ORDER_RESULTS: empty
  ORDER_PROC_ID 945468371  (child, same test)
    → ORDER_RESULTS: CHOLESTEROL=159, HDL=62, LDL=84, TRIG=67, VLDL=13

  ORDER_PARENT_INFO links them:
    PARENT_ORDER_ID=945468368  ORDER_ID=945468371

In our test data, parent and child orders share the same CSN (both
live on the same contact). In larger institutions, the child order
may land on a separate lab-processing contact with a different CSN.
Either way, the ORDER_PROC_ID is always different, and results always
attach to the child's ORDER_PROC_ID.

Without following ORDER_PARENT_INFO, lab results appear disconnected
from the ordering encounter. The Order.allResults(record) method
handles this automatically.


## 5. NOTE LINKING IS INDIRECT
HNO_INFO (notes) has both PAT_ENC_CSN_ID and its own contact CSN.
  - PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = the clinical encounter this note belongs to
  - NOTE_CSN_ID = the note's own contact serial number (internal)

Some notes have NULL PAT_ENC_CSN_ID — these are standalone MyChart
messages, system notifications, or notes not tied to a visit.
Only 57 of 152 notes in our test data link to encounters.
Only 21 of 152 have plain text — the rest may be in RTF format,
were redacted, or are system-generated stubs with metadata only.


## 6. HISTORY TABLES ARE VERSIONED SNAPSHOTS
SOCIAL_HX, SURGICAL_HX, FAMILY_HX_STATUS each have two CSN columns:
  - PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = the history record's own contact CSN (gets own encounter)
  - HX_LNK_ENC_CSN = the clinical encounter where history was reviewed

Each row is a point-in-time snapshot, not a child of any encounter.
They are patient-level versioned records. We model them as
HistoryTimeline<T> with .latest(), .asOfEncounter(csn), .asOfDate(date).


## 7. BRIDGE TABLES FOR PATIENT LINKAGE
Several entity tables store one record per entity (not per patient)
and link to patients through bridge tables:

  ALLERGY ←─── PAT_ALLERGIES ───→ PATIENT (via PAT_ID)
  PROBLEM_LIST ← PAT_PROBLEM_LIST → PATIENT
  IMMUNE ←──── PAT_IMMUNIZATIONS → PATIENT
  ACCOUNT ←─── ACCT_GUAR_PAT_INFO → PATIENT
  HSP_ACCOUNT ← HAR_ALL ──────────→ PATIENT (via PAT_ID + ACCT_ID)

In single-patient exports, you CAN SELECT * and get correct results,
but always join through the bridge for multi-patient correctness.


## 8. CLARITY_* TABLES ARE SHARED LOOKUPS
~23 tables starting with CLARITY_ are reference/dimension tables:
  CLARITY_EDG = diagnoses (DX_ID → DX_NAME)
  CLARITY_SER = providers (PROV_ID → PROV_NAME)
  CLARITY_DEP = departments (DEPARTMENT_ID → DEPARTMENT_NAME)
  CLARITY_EAP = procedures (PROC_ID → PROC_NAME)
  CLARITY_EMP = employees

They're shared across the whole graph — don't nest them anywhere.
Use lookupName() to resolve IDs to display names at projection time.


## 9. BILLING IS A PARALLEL HIERARCHY
Clinical data (PAT_ENC → orders → results) and billing data
(ARPB_TRANSACTIONS → actions → diagnoses → EOB) are parallel trees
connected by cross-references:

  Clinical tree:                    Billing tree:
  PAT_ENC                           ARPB_TRANSACTIONS
    ├── ORDER_PROC                    ├── ARPB_TX_ACTIONS
    │   └── ORDER_RESULTS             ├── ARPB_CHG_ENTRY_DX
    ├── HNO_INFO                      ├── TX_DIAG
    └── PAT_ENC_DX                   └── PMT_EOB_INFO_I/II
                                    ACCOUNT
                cross-ref:           ├── ACCOUNT_CONTACT
  ARPB_VISITS.PRIM_ENC_CSN_ID       └── ACCT_TX
       ↔ PAT_ENC_CSN_ID           HSP_ACCOUNT
                                     ├── HSP_TRANSACTIONS
                                     └── buckets → payments
                                   CLM_VALUES (claims)
                                     └── SVC_LN_INFO
                                   CL_REMIT (remittances)
                                     └── 14 child tables

Don't stuff billing under encounters — it's its own tree.


## 10. EPIC COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS ARE THE ROSETTA STONE
The schemas/*.json files (from open.epic.com) contain natural-language
descriptions for every column. These often include explicit relationship
hints: "frequently used to link to the PATIENT table", "The unique ID of
the immunization record", "The contact serial number associated with the
primary patient contact."

When extending to a new table, ALWAYS read the schema description first.
A human (or LLM) reading descriptions + one sample row can make correct
placement judgments where heuristic FK matching fails.
