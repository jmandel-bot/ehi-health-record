# Mapping Philosophy

## 1. NESTING EXPRESSES OWNERSHIP, NOT ALL RELATIONSHIPS
   Structural children (ORDER_RESULTS under ORDER_PROC) nest directly.
   Cross-references (billing ↔ encounters) use typed IDs + accessor methods.
   Provenance stamps (ALLERGY.ALLERGY_PAT_CSN) are metadata fields.

## 2. CONVENIENCE METHODS LIVE ON THE ENTITY THAT HOLDS THE FK
   encounter.billingVisit(record) — encounter has the CSN, billing visit
   points to it. billingVisit.encounter(record) — reverse direction.
   Both entities carry their own accessor for the relationship.

## 3. THE `record` PARAMETER IS THE INDEX
   Cross-reference accessors take PatientRecord as a parameter so they
   can use O(1) index lookups (encounterByCSN, orderByID). This keeps
   entities serializable and the dependency explicit.

## 4. EpicRow AS ESCAPE HATCH
   We can't type all 550 tables immediately. EpicRow = Record<string, unknown>
   lets child tables land somewhere even before they're fully typed.
   The ChildSpec[] arrays attach children systematically — typing comes later.

## 5. PAT_ID FILTERING FOR MULTI-PATIENT CORRECTNESS
   Every top-level query traces back to PAT_ID, even if the path goes
   through bridge tables (PAT_ALLERGIES, HAR_ALL, ACCT_GUAR_PAT_INFO).
   Single-patient exports happen to work without this, but multi-patient
   databases require it.

## 6. FALLBACK GRACEFULLY
   Every query checks tableExists() before running. If a bridge table is
   missing, fall back to SELECT * (correct for single-patient exports).
   If a child table is absent, skip it. The projection should work for
   partial exports and different Epic versions.
